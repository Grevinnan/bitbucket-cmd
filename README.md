  Bitbucket command line interface  based on https://github.com/germanrcuriel/jira-cmd

  Currently it is able to do these things from the command line: 
  * Store your encrypted bitbucket credentials
  * List pull requests
  * Create pull requets

## Motivation

  As a command line junky, I wanted to be able to create pull requests quickly without having to use bitbucket's browser interface.  I also wanted to be able to list out all pull requests so I could be a more expedient merge master.

## Installation

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Then, in your shell type:

    $ npm install -g bitbucket-cmd

## Usage

##### First use

    $ bitbucket
    bitbucket URL: https://bitbucket.org/
    Username: xxxxxx
    Password: xxxxxx
    Information stored!

This saves your credentials (base64 encoded) in your `$HOME/.bitbucket` folder.

##### Help

Usage: bitbucket [options] [command]

  Commands:

    pr 

  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number

Each command have individual usage help (using --help or -h)

For example the pr command has these options

    -l, --list                  List Open Pull Requests
    -r, --merged                List Merged Pull Requests
    -m, --merge <pr_num>        Merge Pull Request
    -c, --create <title>        Create Pull Request
    -s, --source <branch name>  Source Branch
    -t, --to <branch name>      Destination Branch
    -f, --diff <pr_num>         Diff Pull Request
    -d, --decline <pr_num>      Decline Pull Request

Usage:

bitbucket pr -l

The above command will output something like this:
```

Usage:

```
bitbucket pr -c "test pr" -s feature/MTIE-503-Package-Content -t master
```

It will create a pull request and output something like this:
```
Create Pull Request

```
