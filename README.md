bitbucket-cmd
========

  Bitbucket command line interface  based on https://github.com/germanrcuriel/jira-cmd

  Currently it is able to do these things from the command line: 
  * Store your encrypted bitbucket credentials
  * List pull requests
  * Create pull requets

## Motivation

  As a command line junky, I wanted to be able to create pull requests quickly without having to use bitbucket's browser interface.  I also wanted to be able to list out all pull requests so I could be a more expedient merge master.

## Installation

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Then, in your shell type:

    $ npm install -g bitbucket-cmd

## Usage

##### First use

    $ bitbucket
    bitbucket URL: https://bitbucket.org/
    Username: xxxxxx
    Password: xxxxxx
    Information stored!

This saves your credentials (base64 encoded) in your `$HOME/.bitbucket` folder.
This config behavior was used from the jira-cmd repo listed above.

#### Reviewers

Please note that the "default_reviewers" section is added to the config.json file.  I've added check to see if this section is empty and just submit PR's without reviewers if necessary.  However it is sensitive.  Valid default reviewer syntax is as follows:

```
{
  "auth": {
    "url": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/blabla/myawesomerepo/",
    "user": "yourbbusername",
    "token": "yourpasswordthatistokenizedforyou"
  },
  "options": {
    "default_reviewers": [
    { "username" : "yourbestbud" }
    ]
  }
}

```

or an empty options section like this:
```
{
  "auth": {
    "url": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/blabla/myawesomerepo/",
    "user": "yourbbusername",
    "token": "yourpasswordthatistokenizedforyou"
  },
  "options": { }
}

```
or a list of reviewers like this:
```
{
  "auth": {
    "url": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/blabla/myawesomerepo/",
    "user": "yourbbusername",
    "token": "yourpasswordthatistokenizedforyou"
  },
  "options": {
    "default_reviewers": [
    { "bestreviewer1" ,"bestusername-reviewer2", "bestreviewername3" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Your reviewers are setup in the bitbucket settings section on the bitbucket admin page of the repo.
Please note the password is tokenized and hashed for you.   So when prompted for the password
just paste or type it in, and the bitbucket-cmd will tokenize it for you. That means what 
is stored in config.json is NOT what you typed in,  just fyi.

Beware-of-the-json-death-by-brackets-syntax: Nested objects are a bitch - not much I can do about that. 

##### Help

Usage: bitbucket [options] [command]

  Commands:

    pr 

  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number

Each command have individual usage help (using --help or -h), so `bitbucket pr -h` will give pr specific help. 

For example the pr command has these options

    -l, --list                  List Open Pull Requests
    -r, --merged                List Merged Pull Requests
    -m, --merge <pr_num>        Merge Pull Request
    -c, --create <title>        Create Pull Request
    -d, --description <description>   Description for PR 
    -s, --source <branch name>  Source Branch
    -t, --to <branch name>      Destination Branch
    -f, --diff <pr_num>         Diff Pull Request
    -d, --decline <pr_num>      Decline Pull Request

Usage:

bitbucket pr -l

The above command will output something like this:
```

```

Usage:

To create a pull request you could do it like this:

```
bitbucket pr -c "test pr" -s feature/MTIE-503-Package-Content -t master
```

It will create a pull request and output something like this:
```
Create Pull Request
Created PR @ https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/phase2tech/mti_cms/pullrequests/3127
```

  * --diff and --decline are not working properly.
  * Allow config to handle multiple repos
